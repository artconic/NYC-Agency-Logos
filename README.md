# NYC-Logos
Branded NYC Logos for Citywide agencies.

The Agency Logo’s was created by following the New York City Council’s guide to ‘NYC Brand guidelines’, [https://newyorkcitycouncil.github.io/nycc-brand-guidelines/#media](url). This guide acts as a central location where we house a live inventory of brand guidelines, assets, UI components, code snippets, developer guidelines, and more. Anyone working with Council’s online presence is encouraged to stay familiar with this guide and help ensure that it’s kept up-to-date.
